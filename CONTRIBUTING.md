## Getting Started

The best way to contribute to this project is by adding example notebooks that explain a feature or a strategy in the ArbitrageLab library. 

Ideally you should start by checking out the other notebooks in the repo to see if your notebook follows the presentation standards of these
notebooks. 

Some key points to pay particular attention to are always starting your explantion with an abstract or introduction to the topic and problem statement, 
using data to explain how the strategy or a particular approach solves the problem and generally concluding with a summary. 

Make sure to provide references to papers, articles and journals where the idea was first proposed at the end of the notebook.

Use LaTeX to write mathematical formula and equations.
