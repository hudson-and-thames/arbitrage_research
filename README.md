## Welcome to Arbitrage Research

Welcome to Arbitrage Research, your gateway to unlocking the potential of quantitative strategy development. Within this repository, you'll find a collection of notebooks showcasing the powerful strategies and tools available in the [arbitragelab](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/arbitragelab) library, designed to construct mean-reverting portfolios.

Originally conceived as a research endeavor within Hudson and Thames, a pioneering quantitative research firm dedicated to implementing advanced algorithms drawn from leading academic journals and research papers, arbitragelab has long been the secret weapon of research teams within quantitative hedge funds. Now, in a groundbreaking move, the firm has opted to share this powerful resource with the global community, democratizing access for anyone passionate about developing quantitative strategies.

At its core, the library comprises meticulously crafted implementations of statistical arbitrage strategies documented in academic literature, adhering closely to [Krauss' taxonomy](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/116783/1/833997289.pdf) of Pairs Trading Strategies.

Within this repository, each notebook offers a hands-on exploration of a specific strategy tailored to construct mean-reverting portfolios. The notebooks also provide links and references to papers where the strategy was first proposed. Feel free to check out the links to deepen your understanding of the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings behind each implementation.
